# CovidThunderSystem

Project Background: 
--------------------
Cleveland Clinic and University Hospital are two of the most famous and advanced hospitals in
the United States. And these two hospitals also have the most convicent database system to
provide hospital staff to have better services for the patients. However, due to the influence of
COVID-19, the original database system is not enough to record covid information. Covid
Thunder System is a database hospital system that records covid-19 information of each patient
and hospital staff based on the original hospital information system from Cleveland Clinic. After
using covid Thunder system, the hospital is able to check the covid information of each patient
and hospital staff to monitor their health.

Description
-----------
This is a hospital information system cooperated with Covid-19 information. The database helps large scale hospital or clinic to accurately get the information needed for healthcare providers, patients, and so on. 
Users can check the information of doctors, patients, patients' medical records, COVID test results of both doctors and patients, wards, departments, and operating rooms by clicking on buttons. 
The database is built using MySQL, and the frontend uses Java and javax. 

Project Feature: 
The primary job of a hospital is to treat the patients and take care of them. For a smaller scale
hospital, or clinic where they only have a limited small number of patients, it’s easier to track the
information of the patients and their health care provider. But for a larger hospital, such as
University Hospitals and Cleveland Clinic, it’s important to have a large and well-defined
database to track all the information needed. Who is the healthcare provider of this patient? Did
the patient receive COVID testing? Which room is the patient in? All that information needs to
be put into a database or the information will be messed up.
Our goal is to build a database that supports such functions which would help a large scale
hospital or clinic to accurately get the information needed for healthcare providers, patients,
rooms and so on.
